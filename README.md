# Picture-Ruler

As an iOS developer, I always feel the lack of simple app to check position of objects/elements in any picture or screenshot. Now it's very easy to find position and size of any UI element, specifically {x,y,width,height).

This app is specially designed for making Mobile Quality Assurance Engineer (QA Engg.) life much easier. Now they can quickly review Mobile UI with point & pixel perfect dimensions within minutes.

HOW IT WORKS: Step1: Take Screenshot of the app to debug it. This will automatically be saved to your Camera Roll -> Screenshots album.

Step2: Open Screen Ruler app and you can see your recent screenshot, enable ruler and straight line frame.

Step3: Check your screenshot dimensions and UI element positions by zooming in/out and using rulers and line frame.
